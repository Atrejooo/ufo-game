# Game Engine for Android
This project was my first attempt at creating a game engine from scratch.

## Dependencies
The core of the game engine (GameFrame) and the netcode for multiplayer work without Android Studio. The rest of the engine, namely the rendering, uses Android Studio's OpenGL views.

## How to Run
To run the game, launch the "UFO" activity (UfoGameMainActivity.java).


All assets (images) were created by me.
